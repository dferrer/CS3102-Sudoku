To run the pre-UI version of the solver (which prints solutions to standard output and should be used with the files in the "scripts" folder), paste the contents of oldmain into main.go and run the program with a command-line argument containing the name of the file to be solved. For example, "go run main.go puzzles/hard2/formatted/formatted114.txt" or "bash scripts/solve9x9.sh".

To run the solver with a user interface (in the form of a web app), run the main file as is. This will begin serving HTTP on localhost:8000/web/ (the port can be modified on line 409 of main.go). Open Chrome and go to localhost:8000/web/ in order to see a blank input grid with a solve button beneath it. Enter numbers into each box to form a valid Sudoku, and press the Solve! button. If the Sudoku was valid, this will display a solved Sudoku. "go run main.go" will handle all of this.
